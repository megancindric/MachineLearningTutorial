# Kaggle Machine Learning Tutorial

---

## An introduction to Machine Learning utilizing Kaggle's introductory and intermediate tutorial series

### Conceptual Notes

#### Scenario

    - You are assisting your cousin in creating predictive models to determine how much certain houses are worth
    - Using Machine Learning algorithms, you will create a predictive model to predict real estate values based on past data
    - This process will involve creating **Decision Trees**, similar to binary search trees, which branch to predicted results (leaves, or additonal branches) based on past obeservations of data
    - The more factors we incorperate into our Decision Tree, the *deeper* that decision tree becomes, traversing more and more branches until it reaches it's predicted result!
